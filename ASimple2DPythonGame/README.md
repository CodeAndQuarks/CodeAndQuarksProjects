Basically, a simple haphazard war of attrition game I whipped up in a afternoon, inspired by old arcade games.
Wanted to see how far I could get using only the turtle module for graphics.
A little fine tuning definetly required for the future.
Enjoy defeating Pyschic Spherical Cows in space to your hearts content!
